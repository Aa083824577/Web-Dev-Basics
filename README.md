# Web Dev Basics - My Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of my very first projects and exercises as I embarked on my journey to learn HTML and CSS. It showcases fundamental web development concepts and various styling techniques, representing my initial steps in building for the web.

## About This Repository

This collection is intended to reflect the learning process of a beginner in web development. You'll find examples and practice code covering:

*   **HTML Fundamentals**: From structuring basic web pages with centered divs, to creating various forms (basic registration, advanced layouts, table-based forms), and understanding HTML tables (colspan, rowspan, simple data displays).
*   **CSS Essentials**: Exploring how to style input fields, create responsive card layouts, develop reusable card components, and implement basic centering techniques.
*   **Early CSS Demonstrations**: Demos of CSS animations (like fading squares, moving circles, and animations along a path), and experiments with CSS positioning and transforms (including card layouts with hover effects, interactive link hovers, and rotations).
*   **CSS Exercise Solutions**: A dedicated section with solutions to CSS exercises, which were crucial for practicing and solidifying my understanding.

## Technologies Used (Early Learning Phase)

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
